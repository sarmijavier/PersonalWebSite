                <h4><strong>Bogot치, the city of everybody</strong></h4>

                        Well how you know, Bogot치 is the capital of Colombia. But it supposes that it was founded 482 years old. But frankly,
                        that is a lie, because this territory has hundreds of years of history. To start the name of Bogot치 comes of
                        the native name Bacat치, this was the name of the territory Muisca. Before the Spanish kingdom got here. I wanted to
                        begin with this because is very important, specially if you live here.

                        So later of that explication. I want to talk about the first image, that you saw first. This is the Calera. It's the 
                        popular touristic place in Bogot치. but, it doesn't matter where you are, you always are goint to see a spectacular sunsets and
                        and sunrises. Obviously whether sky is not overcast. This 游녡 is a sunset from Usme a Localidad in Bogot치.  
                    </p>

                        Always there are moments where you can hang out with your friends and drink beer or eat delicious food like
                        empanadas, pasteles, almojabanas, arepas, salchipapas, among others. This image is in a favorite place where 
                        I've found incredible teacher and friends and of course beautiful landscapes.

                        all people think how they want. And with thay way of thinking, they can give awsome solutions to many problems. As in the Andr칠s
                        Oppenheimer's book cities like Bogot치, it's becoming in the new center of innovation and creativity. In this image 游녡 you can see in Rock Al
                        Parque 2019.

                        Other important aspect are the museums, in these we can find more culture and history, these aspects are 
                        very importantthe, because, the people have to know their history and never will repeat it. In Bogot치 you can find
                        old places like this 游녡, where there are colonial architecture and feelings of old Bogot치. The image is the Claustro San Agust칤n
                        in the Bogot치's downtown. I hope you can visit this museum and specially to know the Jesus Abad Colorado's Work. His work is about
                        the history of Colombia.
